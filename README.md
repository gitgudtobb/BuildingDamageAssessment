# BuildingDamageAssessment
This project uses satellite imagery with deep learning and computer vision to detect damage caused by natural disasters like earthquakes and fires. It aims to identify damage in hard-to-reach areas, speeding up post-disaster assessments and improving resource allocation for emergency response.
